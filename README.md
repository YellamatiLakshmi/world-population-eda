🌍 World Population Exploratory Data Analysis using Python

Python-based data analysis & visualization project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete real-world **exploratory data analysis (EDA) workflow using Python** on global population data.  
The dataset originally contained mixed data types, missing values, and complex numerical patterns across multiple years.

The goal was to explore, analyze, and transform the raw dataset into meaningful insights about global population trends and continent-wise growth behavior.

## 🧹 Data Analysis Process
1. Inspected dataset structure and data types  
2. Identified missing values and data inconsistencies  
3. Generated statistical summaries of numerical features  
4. Performed correlation analysis on population metrics  
5. Grouped and aggregated data by continent  
6. Filtered specific regions for deeper analysis  
7. Analyzed population trends across multiple years  
8. Visualized results using line charts, heatmaps, and boxplots  
9. Detected outliers in population distributions  
10. Extracted meaningful analytical insights  

All analysis logic is stored in the main Python script.
